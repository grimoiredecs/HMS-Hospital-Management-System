software requirement

1. functional requirement:
• Patient Management: Register patients, update patient records, manage medical history, and retrieve patient details.

• Appointment Scheduling: Allow patients to book appointments with doctors, update appointment status, and manage doctor availability.

• Billing: Handle patient billing, payment processing, and generate invoices.

• Staff Management: Manage doctor and nurse information, scheduling, and workload tracking.

2. non-functional:
- maintainability: 
+ The system should be designed with clear, modular, and well-documented code that allows for easy debugging, enhancement, and refactoring.

+ The system should include logging and error-handling mechanisms that can aid in troubleshooting and future updates.

- scalability:
+ The HMS should be able to handle a growing number of patients, appointments, staff members, and billing transactions as the hospital expands.

+Patient Management and Appointment Scheduling functionalities must support an increasing volume of patient data without degradation in performance.

+The system must accommodate more staff and doctors, along with their schedules and work logs, as the hospital's network of healthcare providers grows.

- Extensibility:
+ The system must allow for the addition of new modules to be simple to integrate into the existing system with minimal rework.

- flexibility:
+ The HMS should be adaptable to meet varying needs based on the specific hospital's requirements, such as customization in how patient records are managed or how appointments are scheduled.

+ The system should allow for the adjustment of user roles and permissions (for instance, doctors may have more rights to patient data than nurses).

+ The Staff Management module should support different staffing models, allowing for variations in how shifts are scheduled and managed based on the hospital's operational needs.

- modularity:
+ The HMS should be designed with distinct, independently deployable modules to ensure that changes to one module do not impact others
+ Each functionality, such as Patient Management, Appointment Scheduling, Billing, and Staff Management, should be self-contained, enabling updates or changes in one area to occur without disrupting others.
+ Allows hospitals to scale individual parts of the system and upgrade them independently without major system downtime or disruption.
